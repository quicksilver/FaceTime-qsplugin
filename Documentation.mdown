## FaceTime ##

This plug-in adds a FaceTime action.

With a phone number, e-mail address, or contact[^1] selected, choose the FaceTime action in the second pane.

The FaceTime application will ask you to confirm before actually contacting the person.

[^1]: For contacts, the first listed e-mail address will be used. This may or may not be what you want. You should generally select a specific phone number or e-mail address.
